# About
Simple survival game with local multiplayer (with gamepad and keyboard). The main goal is to survive as long as you can. 
To achieve this you should kill enemies by your weapon. 

Player characters can switch between two weapon modes - normal mode (better range and firerate) and shotgun (slower firerate and worse range but more dangerous for frouping enemies).

Be carefull! If enemies are too close they can hit you and, if you let them to do it ten times your character dies.
Also take care about your stamina - if you run for a long time without any break, your aiming skills decrease greatly!

Good luck!
